# üêä Gator: A CLI RSS Blog Aggregator

**Gator** is a command-line tool that aggregates RSS feeds with multi-user support. Users can register, follow feeds (including those added by other users), and browse the latest posts from the feeds they follow. It is designed for **local use only**.

---

## üöÄ Features

* Multi-user support
* Add, follow, and unfollow RSS feeds
* Automatic background aggregation
* Lightweight and easy to use

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) (v1.24+ recommended)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) (v15 or later)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gator.git
   cd gator
   ```

2. Install the CLI:

   ```bash
   go install
   ```

---

## üß∞ Setup

### 1. Install PostgreSQL (v15+)

> If you don't have PostgreSQL installed, follow the [official installation guide](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

### 2. Make sure PostgreSQL is running

Ensure your PostgreSQL server is started and accepting connections. On most systems, this happens automatically at startup. To verify:

```bash
psql -U yourusername -c '\l'
```

If this connects successfully and shows your list of databases, the server is running.

### 3. Create the `gator` database

Start the `psql` shell:

```bash
psql -U yourusername
```

Then run the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE gator;
```

Exit the shell with:

```sql
\q
```

### 4. Configure your database connection

Create a configuration file at `~/.gatorconfig.json` with the following contents:

```json
{
  "db_url": "postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/gator?sslmode=disable"
}
```

Replace `username`, `password`, and other fields with your actual database credentials.
